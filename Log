Added brush loading on world, added collision with brushes to the collision class.

Areas for improvement:
  Player currently does not always collide. This is probably due to the player missing a collision check on the exact frame where they are colliding.
    Solution:
      Have collision with brushes factor in the width and height. If the player is inside of the brush, bring them to the top of the brush.
  Currently check for collision for every single brush on every single frame.
    Solution:
      Divide world into squares, assign square numbers when brush is created. Only check squares within the square that the player is currently in each frame.
       This could be achieved by having an array of brush arrays, each square correlates to an index in the array of arrays. This way we can call that individual index
       and not waste cycles on if statements.
